# ecom-clothing-pipeline

An ELT pipeline that scrapes data from an e-commerce clothing website.

## Objectives

This is a study case project designed to learn how to build ELT pipelines using data engineering frameworks and tools.  
The goal is to create a web scraper that extracts clothing data such as price, category, size, and more, loads it into a database, and transforms the data to be ready for use in a dashboard.

## What I’ve Learned from This Project

So far, I’ve learned the following:

- How to design and implement a web scraping process and architecture  
- How to set up Docker environments to run the project
